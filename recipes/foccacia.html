    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4oz. Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>2tsp Honey</li>
            <li>5cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1tbsp Morten's Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>6tbsp EVOO, plus some for hands</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <!--Figure out the non-numbering issue. After the initial ol, they need to be changed to li-->
        <!--ol changed to li-->
        <ol>
        <li>Whisk yeast, honey, and 2.5 cups of lukewarm water. Let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 5 cups of flour and the salt to the bowl. Mix well until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Pour 4tbsp EVOO into a bowl for fridge. Transfer dough and turn to coat. Cover and chill until
            dough is doubled in size at least-- 8hrs-24hrs. 
            <ul>You can also let the dough rise at room temp for 3-4hrs instead.</ul></li>
        <li>Butter a 13x9" baking tray. Add 1tbsp EVOO into the center of the pan. Keeping
            the dough in the bowl, form dough into a ball, or deflate it. Transfer to buttered pan.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the prepped buttered pan. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot
            for 1.5-4hrs.</li>
        <li>Place oven rack in the middle. Preheat to 450 degrees.</li>
        <li>To see if the dough is ready, poke it with your finger. It should spring back slowly,
            leaving an indentation.</li>
        <li>Oil your hands lightly. Stretch dough to fit pan. Dimple foccacia aggressively. Drizzle
            with olive oil and salt. </li>
        <li>This is where you add your toppings. I personally steal rosemary from my neighbors garden,
            and then leave freshly baked bread on their doorstep in exchange.
            <br>
            I have added kimchi in the past, which was very good, but required no theivery and therefore
            very little interest for me.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden brown all over-- 20-30mins.</li>
    </ol>
